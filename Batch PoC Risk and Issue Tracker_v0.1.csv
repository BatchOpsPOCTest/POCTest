1,Demonstrate the ability to choose between OND007 and OND041 batches,"Essential to determine whether Control-M governance services is required, and separate into the workflow accordingly",Open,,,
2,Project List and Batch type to be provided as drop down ,Batch type and Project are not in a 1-to-1 relationship,In progress,,,
3,Project name and Batch type sync with Project Tracker,,In progress,,,
4,Includes attachment field to upload files,,Completed,27-11-2017,Karthik & Aheli,
5,"TWO Workflows with one that requires estimation, while the other doesn’t","Consider the 3 different type of requests: 1) Control-M uplift, 2) Execution, 3) Both",In progress,,,
6,Dynamic Job List selection (depending on the number of jobs that end user selects),"This integrates with the Runsheet preparation
Karthik is still validating the approach - whether it'll be a drop down, check box etc",Open,,,
7,"Estimation attributes link to the Request form and the formula at the back-end, where estimations are triggered automatically","Explore using other applications/approach as opposed to the existing Batch estimator excel (e.g. store the formulas directly on Jenkins, with flexibility to update when needed)",In progress,,,
8,Estimation summary (remove all the formulas - similar to exisiting word doc format) to be sent to PM via email (with reference number),Allow end user to extract summary of Estimations?,Open,,,
9,PM approve Estimates directly on the tool,Consider of ways in identifying PM on the tool (security control) ,In progress,,,
10,"Job lists as an option for end user to choose which jobs they'd like to run (e.g. 10 out of 10, or 9 out of 10)","Ideally to conduct via dynamic format, and contains ""help text"" as an icon for end user to explain the job type",Open,,,
11,"Integrating ""Help text"" as extra information on the related jobs",Karthik to explore whether this is feasible,Open,,,
12,Automatically create/generate the list of preparation activities required - Runsheet (depending on the type of OND batch and the number of jobs required - view item #10),"This relates to Job List - and each run sheet will be different even it is the same type of batch, but the number of jobs required to run are different (e.g. 9 out of 10 jobs required). 
The not required job can be removed from the runsheet rather than marking as N/A",Open,,,
13,Automate prioritisation decision (behind the tool - not for end user to decide on the prioritisation),"Potential rule for automation:
•         FIFO
•         Processing Date
•         Our team (agents) to suggest which one to prioritise based on how critical one is over than the other
•         If the two requests have the same data, possibility of doing one execution for both batches",Open,,,
14,"Assign to the work queues accordingly based on the 6 different workflow options, and provide input to update at JIRA Software accordingly",View Implementation PowerPoint for more details on flow,Open,,,
15,"Consider the approach in driving the live demo on NAB environment, including critique sessions with stakeholders to capture feedback to optimise the product once the MVP is ready before the 8th Dec",,Open,,,
